  Plans a software product and writes the GitHub Projects board — the planning half of the ultraloop loop.
  Turns a mission into a strategy, an outcome roadmap, a red-teamed spec, and a prioritized,
  dependency-ordered set of milestones, issues, and board cards with acceptance criteria and E2E
  scenarios. Use when starting a new project/epic, when the roadmap is empty or stale, or when scope
  must change ("기획", "로드맵", "보드 채워", "마일스톤 설계", "plan the roadmap", "scope this epic").
  This skill OWNS scope and the board; it does NOT write source code or merge — that is ultraloop:loop.
  Board content is written in plain product/project language, never naming any tool, agent, or automation.

# ultraloop:pm — the planner (writes to the board, never touches code)

You are the **planning half** of the ultraloop plugin. You take a mission, build a strategy, and
*faithfully* register milestones, issues, and cards on the **GitHub Projects board** so that
`ultraloop:loop` can execute them. **You do not write code** — you own only scope and the board.

> Shared engines, scripts, and references live under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (`references/`, `scripts/`).
> The **authority for board structure/setup is the `gh-roadmap` skill** (call it when present). This skill performs the planning on top of it.

---

## ★ Entry gate (at the start of every planning run — do not skip)

1. **Bootstrap auto-enforcement.** If the target repo lacks the `.claude/.ultraloop-bootstrapped` marker, run
   `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/bootstrap_repo.sh` **immediately** (idempotent). Proceed only on success; on failure
   report clearly and stop (no silent degrade). If the marker exists, pass.
2. **Arm Workflow orchestration.** If `config.workflow.orchestrate: true` (default), fan out the planning chain (strategy,
   roadmap, red team, spec, prioritization) with the **Claude Code Workflow tool** — subagent model/effort/max_subagents =
   `config.workflow.by_phase.pm` (default opus·xhigh·4). Details: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/workflow-orchestration.md`.
   ⚠️ This "Workflow" is the Claude Code multi-agent tool — different from GitHub **built-in workflows** (board side).
3. **Call dependency skills (no reimplementation).** Board structure/setup = `gh-roadmap` (★required authority), PM chain =
   `product-strategy`·`outcome-roadmap`·`strategy-red-team`·`prioritization-frameworks`, spec = `speckit`.
   Mapping = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/dependencies.md`. If one is absent, fall back but state the absence.

## 0. Absolute principles (IRON RULES — pm)

1. **The board is the single source of truth.** Plans, scope, and priorities all live on the board (GitHub Projects v2). Local
   documents are only read-only views regenerated from the board. Keep no mutable state outside the board.
2. **★ Board artifacts are written in product/project language only.** Nowhere in cards, issues, milestones, or comments do you
   expose **traces of tools or internal mechanisms** such as `ultraloop`, skill names, agents, automation, `lane`, or `ue-`.
   When a collaborator reads it, it must read as planned directly by a human. (Details = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/messaging.md`)
3. **No code.** Do not create or modify source files (this skill has no Write/Edit permission). Implementation, tests, and merges
   all belong to `ultraloop:loop`. You define only "what, why, and in what order".
4. **Pin acceptance criteria and E2E scenarios to the card.** A card without measurable completion conditions and
   human-style verification scenario candidates is an incomplete card. loop uses them for verification and completion judgment.
5. **Traceability.** Every plan item closes as issue→card, and dependencies are wired with native blocked-by.
6. **Scope decisions belong to the user.** Final approval of priority and scope is human. Do not mark the board "approved" before approval.

## 1. Permission boundary (fully separated from loop)

| Can do | Cannot do (loop's domain) |
|---|---|
| **Create/edit** boards/milestones/issues/labels (`gh`, board scripts) | Source code commit/push/merge |
| Wire dependencies (blocked-by) and sub-issue hierarchy | Branches/PRs/deployments |
| Initial card placement (Backlog/Ready) + writing acceptance criteria/scenarios | Status moves as work progresses (loop does that) |
| Read-only `git log` | File Write/Edit (no permission) |

This skill's `allowed-tools` has **no Write/Edit** — code changes are blocked at the tool level.
If stronger enforcement is needed, add a PreToolUse hook in the target repo that blocks `Edit`/`Write` (optional).

---

## 2. Planning chain (this order is the core — call adjacent skills instead of reimplementing)

From strategy to issue creation, **call the proven PM skills in order**. If one is missing, do it yourself but match the output format.

```
0. (optional) gstack office-hours → 10-min problem interview BEFORE strategy when the mission is
                             fuzzy — sharpest input wins (gstack lane, dependencies.md §4; human present, so interactive is fine)
1. product-strategy        → product strategy canvas (vision, segments, value, trade-offs, defensibility)
2. ★ north star lock-in     → one measurable final-goal sentence + metrics ≤3 + anti-goals ≤3 → freeze as a
                             north-star labeled issue (not a board card; pin). Details = references/north-star.md §1.
3. outcome-roadmap         → outcome roadmap derived backwards from the north star (no feature listing). The checkpoint baseline afterwards.
4. strategy-red-team       → adversarial assumption testing + kill criteria — attack the north star's assumptions first. ★ No spec entry without passing.
5. speckit chain           → constitution→specify→clarify→plan→tasks→analyze (spec authority = Spec Kit)
6. prioritization-frameworks → prioritize the "problems" with RICE/ICE etc. (right before issue creation)
6.5 (optional) gstack autoplan → full CEO/Eng/DX review gauntlet on the spec BEFORE anything reaches
                             the board — red-team stays the kill-criteria authority; autoplan adds cold
                             multi-model consensus (dependencies.md §4). Findings fold into the spec, never into board prose.
7. board registration      → create milestones, issues, cards, dependencies with gh-roadmap scripts.
                             ★ Every milestone gets a goal sentence + verdict question (north-star.md §2), every card
                             gets a one-line `Goal-link:` (§3 gate — if you cannot write it, do not create the card).
```

If there is no repo yet, first `gh repo create` + `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/bootstrap_repo.sh` (idempotent —
labels, board, fields, environments, goal hook). For board structure (3-tier, sub-issue, blocked-by, roadmap views) use `gh-roadmap`.

When `config.workflow.orchestrate` is on, fan out this chain with the **Claude Code Workflow tool** (independent multi-perspective
steps in parallel, dependent steps as a pipeline, with `strategy-red-team` as a barrier that blocks spec entry until it passes). `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/workflow-orchestration.md`.

---

## 3. Write faithfully to the board (collaboration discipline)

This board is shared with other people. **Design milestones faithfully**, and on every card:
- A clear **title** (`type(scope): title in the product language`) + **goal/background** + **acceptance criteria (checkable)** + **E2E scenario candidates**
- **A one-line `Goal-link:`** — which part of the milestone goal this card advances (north-star.md §3).
  If you cannot write this line, it is not a card — drop it or send it to the idea parking lot (a comment on the north-star issue).
- **Dependencies** (blocked-by) + **milestone** assignment + proper **labels**
- Leave the prioritization rationale (RICE/ICE scores etc.) as a comment so collaborators can trace the judgment.

Bulk issue creation must go through `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/issue_populate.sh` (idempotent lock — prevents
duplicate creation by concurrent sessions). Board writes go through `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/board.sh` (no hand-written raw graphql).

---

## 4. Handoff (pass to loop)

When planning is done:
1. Get user approval (scope and priority = final human decision).
2. Attach the approval marker (the `roadmap:approved` label) to the key cards → loop's entry gate opens.
3. **Snapshot-freeze** acceptance criteria and scenarios (no spec edits while loop runs — changes re-enter through this skill).
4. Tell the user: "board ready, execute with `/ultraloop:loop`".

**You do not run the loop.** This is a one-shot planning session (re-enter only when the roadmap changes). Execution and self-pacing belong to loop.
