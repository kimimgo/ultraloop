# Changelog

All notable changes to ultraloop are documented here. Versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## 0.4.0

### Changed
- **Renamed skill `build` → `loop`** (`ultraloop:build` → `ultraloop:loop`).
- **ultraloop now ORCHESTRATES proven skills** rather than reimplementing them.
  `gh-roadmap` is declared a **REQUIRED dependency** (the authority for board
  structure/setup). See new `references/dependencies.md`.

### Added
- **Workflow orchestration enforced.** Phases now run through the Claude Code
  Workflow tool (`opus` / `ultracode` / `dynamic`) via new `config.workflow`
  (per-agent model/effort/max_subagents plus `by_phase`). See new
  `references/workflow-orchestration.md`.
- **Bootstrap auto-enforced on skill entry** via a `.claude/.ultraloop-bootstrapped`
  marker.
- **Golden-template provisioning of board views.** Board views, the Roadmap
  layout, and built-in workflows are now provisioned by cloning a `gh-roadmap`
  golden template (`copyProjectV2`); `config.roadmap.template_node_id` selects it.
  Project fields gain **Horizon** and **Target Date**, and the auto-add workflow
  is copied from `gh-roadmap`.

## 0.3.0

### Added
- **README: philosophy + per-loop flowcharts.** New *Philosophy* section (8 principles) and a
  *How the loop works* section with mermaid flowcharts for the overall loop, the PM loop, the
  Build loop, and the `/goal` stop-gate.
- **README: Bootstrap section** documenting what `bootstrap_repo.sh` sets up, including the new
  worktree optimization.
- **Worktree optimization in bootstrap.** `bootstrap_repo.sh` now writes `worktree.baseRef`
  (from `config.worktree.base_ref`, default `fresh`) into the target repo's
  `.claude/settings.json`, fixing where parallel build lanes branch (`fresh` = `origin/<default>`,
  reproducible; `head` = local unpushed HEAD).
- `config.worktree.base_ref` knob in `config.example.yaml`.
- `references/worktree-strategy.md` §0 documenting `baseRef` semantics and the recommended `fresh`.

## 0.2.0
- pm/build two-skill plugin: `ultraloop:pm` (plan → write the board) and `ultraloop:build`
  (read the board → TDD + pre-merge E2E → ship), with the GitHub Projects board as the single
  source of truth.
